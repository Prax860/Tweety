🐦 MCP Twitter Tweet Server
This is a minimal MCP (Message Control Protocol)-based server built to interact with the Twitter API. The server listens for client commands and creates tweets programmatically using Twitter's API (OAuth 1.0a or 2.0). Ideal for experimenting with automated tweet creation, bots, or Twitter-integrated applications.
